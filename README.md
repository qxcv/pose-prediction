# Pose prediction code

This repository contains some of the code for "[Human Pose Prediction via Deep
Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09240.pdf)" (Toyer et al., DICTA'17).
Specifically, this repository contains data-preprocessing code and code to train
and run the baselines. Code for training a deep Markov model & generating
predictions is in [this complementary
repo](https://github.com/qxcv/structuredinference). However, the instructions
below apply to both repos.
